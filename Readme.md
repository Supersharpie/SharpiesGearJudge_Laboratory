# Sharpie's Gear Judge [Laboratory]

## Overview
* **The Laboratory is a specialized module for the Sharpie's Gear Judge (SGJ) addon, specifically designed for the World of Warcraft Classic: The Burning Crusade Anniversary Server.
* **It provides a powerful side-by-side gear comparator that allows you to simulate and score potential gear sets against your current stat weights without needing to physically own or equip the items.

* **Whether you are importing a "Best-in-Slot" list from SeventyUpgrades or testing a single upgrade from a chat link, the Lab provides instant feedback on which configuration is superior.

### Features
* **Dual Set Comparison: Build two full gear sets (Set 1 and Set 2) to see a direct score comparison.
* **Multi-Format Import: Supports importing gear from SeventyUpgrades (JSON), SimulationCraft (SimC), and raw item ID lists.
* **Live Score Delta: Displays a real-time calculation of which set is better and by exactly how much score.
* **Stat Breakdown: A scrollable list showing side-by-side stat totals (AP, Crit, Hit, etc.) with color-coded differences.
* **Smart Slotting: Intelligently handles 2H vs. 1H weapon conflicts and automatically fills empty Ring/Trinket slots.
* **Save/Load System: Save your favorite theorycrafted sets locally to your character's database.

### How to Use
* **Open the Lab: Access the "The Lab" tab within the main Sharpie's Gear Judge interface.
